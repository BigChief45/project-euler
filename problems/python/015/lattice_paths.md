# Problem #15 - Lattice Paths

![Lattice Grid Example](https://projecteuler.net/project/images/p015.gif)

> Starting in the top left corner of a 2x2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
> How many such routes are there through a 20x20 grid?


## SOLUTION

*Jaime Alvarez - March 2016*

This problem does not require programming. 

From this source: [http://www.robertdickau.com/manhattan.html](http://www.robertdickau.com/manhattan.html):

>... each of the points is described by the binomial coefficients, and the sequence of path counts for lattices of different sizes is 1, 2, 6, 20, 70, â€¦, also known as the central binomial
>coefficients.

According to the source, the total amount of lattice pathways in a *n x n* grid is equal to twice *n* combination of *n*. In other words, the total amount of pathways is equal to the following (where *n* is the dimension of the grid):

Since *n = 20* for a 20x20 grid, we can simply use a [combination calculator](http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/discretemathematics/combinations.php) to obtain the answer: **137846528820**
